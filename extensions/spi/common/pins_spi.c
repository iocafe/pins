  - Run sequentially. Set speed and chip select pin. Send request. Wait for reply.
    Get reply and process it. The pinsGenerateSpiRequest() is called to generate the request
    and pinsProcessSpiResponce() to process it. Main loop calls this for every SPI device in turn.
  - Threaded variation. Much the same as previous one, but every SPI bus has own thread which
    runs the SPI bus sequence, one device at a time: "run set speed and cs, send request, wait,
    get reply and process it."
  - Interrupt based variation. Each SPI bus is run as state machine. State information contains
    which SPI device in this bus has the turn. And are we waiting for speed setting to take
    affect, waiting for reply, etc. Interrupt is timed, we never wait in interrup handler,
    just return is thing waited for is not yet ready.
  - We can also run SPI without waiting from the single threaded main loop.
