MCP3208
notes 16.8.2020/pekka

MCP3208 is 8-Channel 12-Bit A/D converters chip created by Microchip Technology Inc, which connects
to microcontroller trough SPI bus. This chip is nice for hobbyist, it is simple to program and is
available as 16-PDIP (pins for trough holes) which is perfect for breadboard or home made PCB
prototyping. There is also 4 channel version of the chip, MCP3204.

- Device are successive approximation 12-bit Analogto-Digital (A/D) Converters with on-board sample and hold circuitry. 
- The MCP3208 is programmable to provide four pseudo-differential input pairs or eight single-ended inputs. 
- Single supply operation: 2.7V - 5.5V
- 100 ksps max. sampling rate at V DD = 5V, 50 ksps max. sampling rate at V DD = 2.7V
